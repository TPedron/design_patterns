# design_patterns

Simple implementations of many common Design Patterns in Ruby without Rails or other gems.

# Creation Patterns

## Factory Pattern

### Description
Factory classes conforming to the same interface that build different but similar objects, factories can be swapped out in different contexts to build the correct object

### Example
The example implements a Fruit building application that selects the correct FruitBuilder factory.

## Abstract Pattern

### Description
Same as the â€œFactory Method Pattern" but each factory builds multiple object-types that are related

### Example
Copy/Paste of the Factory Pattern example and added an extra relevant object to be built by each FruitBuilder.  The FruitCreator business logic builds a dessert type based on 2 models built by each sub-factory class.

## Singleton Pattern

### Description
Class with a private constructor and a public class method called instance that returns a single instance of the class that was generated from within.  Bad practice to use most of the time.

### Example
The Singleton is some sort of global state with a score attribute (maybe for a game or something)

# Structural Patterns

# Behavioral Patterns

## Strategy Pattern

### Description
Composition over inheritance! Instead of classes inheriting behaviours from each other in a bad hierarchy, move towards extracting behaviour into components that can reused across classes.

### Example
Ruby supports duck-typing so I figured I would implement a few Duck classes that inherit/override behaviors like Quack, Fly and Swim. All behaviors are swappable components conforming to an interface.

## Observer Pattern

### Description
Obvervable subject classes publish notifications on state change to 1+ Observer classes that are subscribed to the subject. Observer classes are instantiated with the subject so there is a link to the class to access the new state when notified.

### Example
Account class allows services to subscribe for updates to the account (in this case, SMS and Email services subscribe and perform their own business logic)
